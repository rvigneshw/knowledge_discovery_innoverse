All these chemicals are mixed together in a rotating drum to form the colour which is then sprayed on the leather hides using a spray gun.Leather requires 5- 6 layers of different chemical mixes coated using spray gun at different intervals and each coat having different formula and proportion.Operators tend to miss out a chemical or change the order of feeding chemicals and thereby changing the chemical composition of the colour.The system should incorporate a washing mechanism to its mixing drum, wherein the drum should be washed after every cycle of chemical mixing.This task of picking up chemicals from the storage area, weighing and feeding, is manual in nature and is not efficient as it is prone to errors.This colour has a standard formula of making, with definite proportion of various chemicals mixed in sequence.The chemicals required for making the dye, are stored in small drums with capacity 15-20 kgs.
